# DisIsNotCord

This is a very basic website that allows you to send messages between two accounts.
It is like a clone of Discord but much worse.

It is coded in Python and HTML using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
It uses sockets to update the client webpage as messages are sent.

Also, just for fun, I coded the entire python backend in one file.
